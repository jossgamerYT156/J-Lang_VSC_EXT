  "markdown-description": "J-Lang is a Pseudo Programming Language made by LillyDev for educational purposes while trying to explain basic programming to non-developers as they learn with simple syntax and easy to remember functions. # Syntax Highlight: # Functions like: `activityClass()`, `print(\")` and others have been color coded for \"easy reading\" as well, strings have been color coded for easy reading. J-Lang VSC Extension is part of a Github project named by the same name that you can find at: [Lilly's Official GitHub Repo](https://github.com/jossgamerYT156/J-Lang) # File extensions addmited by this extension: `.jl` # Recommended usage: Aside of J-Lang_Interpreter for your platform # Linux and MS-Windows only ones supported # J-Lang is made for educational purposes only, to explain and make coding more simple and understandable for non-developers! ## At this development point: J-Lang for Visual Studio Code doesn't rectify syntax errors, yet functions like such will be added soon as well as more functions for J-Lang Scripting. Thank you for reading! Enjoy your coding adventure with J-Lang! ATTE: LillyDev",
