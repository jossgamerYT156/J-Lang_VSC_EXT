## J-Lang is a Pseudo Programming Language made by LillyDev for educational purposes while
## trying to explain basic programming to non-developers as they learn with simple syntax
## and easy to remember functions.


# Syntax Highlight:

# Functions like:
`activityClass()`, `print(")` and others have been color coded for
"easy reading"

as well, strings have been color coded for easy reading.

J-Lang VSC Extension is part of a Github project named by the same name that you can find at:
[Lilly's Official GitHub Repo](https://github.com/jossgamerYT156/J-Lang)

# File extensions addmited by this extension:
`.jl`

# Recommended usage:
Aside of J-Lang_Interpreter for your platform


# Linux and MS-Windows only ones supported

# J-Lang is made for educational purposes only, to explain and make coding more simple and understandable for non-developers!

## At this development point:
J-Lang for Visual Studio Code doesn't rectify syntax errors, yet functions like such will be added soon as well as more functions for J-Lang Scripting.


Thank you for reading!

Enjoy your coding adventure with J-Lang!
